:bf:yknow, flipaclip isn't a bad animation program at all
:dad:Hm?
:bf:People Call it bad, yet it's literally just like any other program
:bf:the reason its so "bad" is because many people have access to it due to it being free
:dad:ur right
:bf:if adobe animate were free, people would be making those same cringy animations
:bf:theres a lot of good flipaclip animators out there.
:bf:my personal favorite is Terenry RM their flipaclip animations are god like.
:bf:even if some peoples animations can be considered cringy its good to encourage them to get better and make more like you!
:bf:your old animations are kinda cringy and bad but over time you got better so much so you made this mod!
:dad:Breaking the forth wall much?
:bf:Okay I'll shut up
:dad:Lets make some noise
:bf:Skeeba beeba
:bf:btw, check the freeplay menu for a short meme song
